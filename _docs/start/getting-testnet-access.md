## Getting Testnet Access

{% include youtube-player.html id=page.yt-id start=page.yt-start stop=page.yt-stop %}

Your testnet adventure starts in the [Hedera portal](https://go.hedera.com)

To get started, complete the following steps:

1. Visit the [Hedera portal](https://go.hedera.com)
2. Create a Hedera profile by confirming a valid email address and setting a password
3. Once in the portal, complete identity verification
4. Enter a testnet access code. Testnet access codes are provided at Meetups and hackathon events. If you do not have a testnet access code you can register your interest via a link found in the [Hedera portal](https://go.hedera.com).

_Should the automated identity verification fail, please email compliance@hedera.com with your name and email used to create your account._
